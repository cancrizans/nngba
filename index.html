			</div>


			<p><strong>Nngba</strong> is a conlang (fictional language) I am developing for my webcomic <a href="https://cancrizans.github.io/fk">Flesh Kernel</a>, one of <a href="https://cancrizans.github.io/fk/clongs">a few</a>. Nngba is the historical language of Humans after the invasion of planet Earth by Grey aliens from Zeta Reticuli. It was born as a mean for <strong>human slaves</strong> to communicate in secrecy. The philosophy is of <strong>hiding crucial information in plain sight</strong> - Nngba is a loud, deceivingly transparent language where what matters is always hidden behind a thick layer of deceiving patterns. An Nngba speaker is even partially shielded against mind-reading attacks as the language intentionally misdirects the speaker's own train of thought, always preferring the most obtuse, roundabout road to communication. Nngba is a language of abstruse metaphors, ironic inversions, and <strong>criptographic grammar</strong>. Nevertheless, it is not a difficult language to <em>learn</em> by any means - it's easy to speak, but very hard to understand if you're not in the loop.</p>

			<p>More in-universe info in the <a href="https://tscomix.fandom.com/wiki/Nngba">wiki page</a>; this page is for details about the language's structure.</p>


			<h2>Phonology (for dummies)</h2>

			<p>This is a quick and dirty informal guide to how the letters of the Nngba alphabet are pronounced. (A more technical presentation of the phonology follows after).</p>

			<p>The letters <strong>p, b, t, d, k, m</strong> should be obvious. <strong>g</strong> is always a hard g, as in <em>get</em>.</p>

			<p>The sequence <strong>gb</strong> is a single sound that is somewhat of a simultaneous <strong>g</strong> and <strong>b</strong>. You want to make contact with the back of your mouth with your toungue as you would making a <strong>g</strong>, while at the same time closing your lips as to say a <strong>b</strong>, then release both together. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UoOJs23GmA">Here is a video guide</a>. It's very tricky - it's acceptable if you can only manage <strong>g</strong> followed by a <strong>b</strong>. Similarly, <strong>kp</strong> is a simultaneous <strong>k</strong> and <strong>p</strong>, and <strong>nm</strong> is a simultaneous <strong>ng</strong> and <strong>m</strong>.</p>

			<p>The double letters <strong>tt</strong> and <strong>dd</strong> are retroflex. Try saying <em>butter</em> in an American accent and focus on the <strong>er</strong> part - your tongue should have its tip quite far back and maybe even curled up a bit backwards (retroflected). With the tongue in that position, try saying a <strong>t</strong> or a <strong>d</strong>. When you manage to do it, it will sound very distinct from normal <strong>t,d</strong>: those are the <strong>tt</strong> and <strong>dd</strong> sounds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU7H_aiG-kc">Video guide for dd</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>a, i, u</strong> are very simple, they are short vowels with exactly the same sound as they have in, say, Spanish. <strong>o</strong> is an "open-o", like in <em>thought</em>. Instead, <strong>e</strong> is a schwa vowel, like the <em>u</em> in <em>supply</em> - think of the laziest vowel you could possibly make. Sequences of two different vowels are pronounced like a glide from one to the other. The only exception is <strong>ui</strong> which is read <em>oi</em> with a "closed-o" like in Spanish <em>hoy</em>.</p>


			<p>Double vowels <strong>aa ii uu oo</strong> (there is no <strong>ee</strong>) are versions of the single letter counterparts that sound slightly longer and must be pronounced with a <strong>creaky voice</strong>. Distinguish clearly the shorter version by using a normal, non-creaky voice.</p>


			<p>When you see <strong>!</strong>, it's a <strong>click consonant</strong>. Clicks are loud popping sounds produced by sucking air trapped with the tongue, and that you can probably already make and use daily, just not as part of speaking. Nngba has three types, <strong>!, !x, !l</strong>. For <strong>!</strong> put your tongue in position to say a <strong>t</strong>, then pull it down abruptly to make a very loud <em>pop</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Postalveolar_click.ogg">audio of !</a>). It's actually quite difficult to follow this sound with an <strong>i</strong>, so in <strong>!i</strong> the click is instead pronounced dentally, as in <em>tut tut!/tsk tsk!</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dental_click.ogg">audio of dental !</a>). The second click <strong>!x</strong> is a lateral click, a squeakier <em>tchick</em> in which you suck air from the sides of the mouth - it's the sound you use to get a horse moving (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alveolar_lateral_click.ogg">audio of !x</a>). The third, <strong>!l</strong>, involves sucking the tongue <em>back</em>, for a deeper <em>clop</em> sounds with which you'd imitate a horse trotting (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Palatoalveolar_click.ogg">audio of !l</a>). It's not particularly difficult to learn to make and distinguish these sounds, but it takes a bit of practice to follow them immediately with a vowel - that's normal, you are switching quickly from inhaling to exhaling.</p>

			<p>The three clicks come with three nasal variations <strong>~!, ~!x, ~!l</strong> in which you also talk through your nose while you perform the click. Sing an <em>nngg...</em> sound and make the click. It's easier than it sounds. The vowel which follows a nasal click will be nasal as well, like in French. So it becomes a bit easier to tell apart <strong>!aa</strong> from <strong>~!aa</strong> because the <strong>aa</strong> becomes nasal in the second example (it is long and creaky voiced in both).</p>

			<p>The letter <strong>n</strong> has a very free array of possible pronunciations. When it's not adjacent to a vowel, like in the very word <strong>Nngba</strong>, it becomes kind of a vowel itself, like in <em>button</em>. It comes in a short <strong>n</strong> and long <strong>nn</strong> variant. In any case, it changes and adapt to consonants that follow: in <strong>ntt, ndd</strong> the tongue curls backwards already on the <strong>n</strong>, and in <strong>nk, ng</strong> it is pronounced farther back exactly like in <em>sing</em>, <em>tank</em>.</p>

			<p><strong>z</strong> is always vowel-like, a buzzing sound as in <em>zoo</em>. <strong>zz</strong> is longer.</p>

			<p>Lastly, <strong>l</strong> is pretty much always obvious. The only exception is <strong>kl, gl</strong> in which <em>optionally</em> the <strong>l</strong> sound can be pronounced much farther back - you could call it a <em>very dark</em> l.</p>

				<li>
					<p>The four long creaky-voiced vowels <span>/a̰ː ḭː ɔ̰ː ṵː/</spa> are usually actually barely longer than normal, with creaky phonation being the most distinguishing characteristic, to the extent that, say, short creaky-voiced [a̰] is perceived as allophonic to /a̰ː/ and not /a/. Nevertheless, the romanisation uses double letters for these sounds.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p><span class="ipa">z̩n̩</span> is also classified as a diphthong because why not. <span class="ipa">/oi/</span> was really originally <span class="ipa">/ui/</span> but it has underwent a sound shift; in romanisation it is still represented as ⟨ui⟩. Diphthongs are as long as a long vowel. <span class="ipa">/ai oi/</span> are allophonic with <span class="ipa">[aːj uːj]</span> and <span class="ipa">/au ua/</span> with <span class="ipa">[aːw waː]</span>. There are no distinct <span class="ipa">/j w/</span> phonemes.</p>
					</li>



					<li>
						<p><span class="ipa">/n ~ l/</span> which encompass <span class="ipa">[n] [ɳ] [ŋ] [l] [ɭ] [ʟ]</span> are allophonic variations or contextual realisations of a single phoneme/archiphoneme, call it <span class="ipa">/N/</span>. Depending on context, it's pronounced as</p>

						<table class="compact_table unicode_font">
							<tr><th>Context</th><th>Realisation</th></tr>
							<tr><td>stop + N</td> <td>liquid w/ same articulation as the stop</td></tr>
							<tr><td>N + stop</td> <td>nasal w/ same articulation as the stop</td></tr>
							<tr><td>vowel + N + vowel</td> <td>n</td></tr>
						</table>

						<p>Note that in the rare case <span class="ipa">/Ngm/</span> which is <span class="ipa">/ŋgm/</span> this is not phonemically distinct from <span class="ipa">/ŋ͡m/</span>. When <span class="ipa">/N/</span> occurs before a syllabic <span class="ipa">/n̩/</span>, it is always pronounced as <span class="ipa">/ln̩/</span> independently of context. If <span class="ipa">/n̩n/</span> occurs, it's not phonemically distinct from <span class="ipa">/n̩ː/</span>.

						<p>(k,g) + N, which is (k,g) + l, can even go as far as the pre-stopped <span class="ipa">[ɡ͡ʟ]</span>, a characteristic sound of of the language, though simple <span class="ipa">[gl]</span> is a perfectly valid realisation.</p>
					</li>




					<li>
						<p>Ejectives <span class="ipa">[pʼ bʼ]</span> can be substituted to the difficult coarticulated <span class="ipa">/k͡p ɡ͡b/</span>.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>The glottal stop <span class="ipa">/ʔ/</span> is on the boundary between phonemic and not; it is used epenthetically, specifically inserted between adjacent vowels that do not belong to the same syllable. Between words, it is not marked. It can happen only in the middle of a word due to bracketing, in which case it's denoted by an apostrophe <strong>'</strong></p>
					</li>

					<li>The click /!/ can be allophonically realised as dental or alveolar<span class="ipa">[ǀ ǃ]</span>, with no distinction. It's generally alveolar <span class="ipa">[ǃ]</span> before <span class="ipa">/a o u z̩ n̩/</span>, dental <span class="ipa">[ǂ]</span> before <span class="ipa">/i/</span>.</li>

					<li>All clicks contrast with their nasalised counterparts, even after a syllabic or consonant nasal. Vowels following a nasal click, short or long-creaky, are themselves nasalised.</li>

				</ol>

				<p>Nngba is written using only ASCII characters, and can be written on most typewriters. The romanisation is as follows:</p>


				<table class="compact_table unicode_font phonetic_table">
					<tr><th>Phoneme</th><td>ʈ</td><td>ɖ</td><td>n</td><td>ɳ</td><td>ŋ</td><td>l</td><td> ɭ</td><td>ʟ</td><td>ŋ͡m</td><td>k͡p</td><td>ɡ͡b</td></tr>

					<tr><th>Romanisation</th><td>!</td><td>!x</td><td>!l</td><td>~!</td><td>~!x</td><td>~!l</td><td>'</td><td>n</td><td>z</td><td>e</td><td>o</td><td>ui</td><td>double letters</td></tr>
				</table>

				<p>Everything else uses the same symbol as in the IPA. Some may also romanise <span class="ipa">ŋ͡m</span> as ngm, but the g glyph is not really necessary as the sequence <span class="ipa">nm</span> (with non-syllabic n) cannot occur.</p>

				<p>Traditionally the rare romanised texts in Nngba were entirely in uppercase, with no spaces. With the modern conventions, one capitalises normally according to the Reticulan standard. If a word to be capitalised doesn't start in a latin letter, however, one capitalises the first one in the word, for example, in the Nngba proper name ~!Liini.</p>

				<h3>Phonotactics</h3>

				<p>Words are typically one or two syllables long; the rare inflection can increase this number slightly. Bracketing (explained later) can make some unusually long words.</p>

				<p>Syllable structure is as follows:</p>

				<div class="bigger">C(l₁)V(N₂)</div>

				<p>With C any consonant or ', and V strictly one of the allowed vowels or diphthongs, plus some restrictions. Specifically, if C = N, then l₁ can not be there. If the vowel V is a syllabic n, nn, or zn, then N₂ can not be there. If the next syllable opens with any nasal (m, n or nm), then (N₂) can be present but must be realised as l.</p>

				<p>An ``isolated'' N, which means between two vowels as V₁NV₂, is realised as l if V₁ is n, nn, zn. Otherwise, n ~ l are both valid allophonic realisations of N, which is why n and l cannot be said to be distinct phonemes: <strong>puuna</strong> and <strong>puula</strong> are the same word.</p>

				<h3>Syntax and Topic-comment</h3>

				<p>Nngba is <strong>topic-prominent</strong>, which means it puts weight on the distinction between the <em>topic</em> of a sentence, which is what is being talked about, and the <em>comment</em>, which is what it's being said about it. The topic is placed at the beginning of phrases:</p>

				<p><strong>Dui ~!lokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<p>Imagine we want to communicate something slightly different. For example, someone asks "who speaks Nngba here?" and you want to reply "I speak Nngba", as in "Nngba is spoken by me". Even if grammatically the sentence is the same as before, we reinterpret it with Nngba as the topic and "I speak it" as the comment. So it would be said</p>

				<p><strong>Nngba dui ~!lokpe.</strong> </p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<h3>Inverse alignment</h3>

				<em>Inspired by some Meso- and North American languages (ex. Huastec, Algonquian, Navajo...) </em>

				<p>Nngba has a specific alignment system which is vaguely of the Direct-Inverse class and it's designed to prevent repeating particles appearing in a way that could betray the presence of noun classes or hierarchies, while still being relatively if not incredibly simple to work out if you know it already. In a sentence like this</p>

				<p><strong>Dui gboo!n maambe.</strong> 1s eat pear <em>I eat a pear.</em></p>

				<p>it's not really necessary to mark subject and object with either syntax (word order) or morphology (case marking or inflections). It's clear that since "I" is more animate than "pear" it's very likely going to be that I eat the pear rather than the pear eating me, so this is the <em>default</em> reading of sentences. In general there is a specific <strong>indexability hierarchy</strong> of arguments; when there are multiple arguments in a sentence, the outranking one is intended as subject and the other as object.</p>

				<p>If we want to mark specifically that the hierarchy is being inverted, for example we want to say "the pear eats me", we use a specific <strong>Inverse</strong> marker. But this marker is placed on the verb instead of on the arguments (if it was placed on one of the args, it would betray their position in the hierarchy and thus possibly other information about their true meaning, and if it was placed on both, it could risk being too repetitive and easily identified).</p>

				<p><strong>Dui gboo!ndi maambe.</strong> 1s eat-INV pear <em>The pear eats me</em></p>

				<p>To figure out ranking</p>

				<ol> 
					<li>

						<p class="bigger">verb-compatible > verb-incompatible</p>


						<p>That is if it is really unusual for one of the arguments to have been the subject, it gets outranked. (In "The wolf mauled the rabbit", the wolf outranks the rabbit since the rabbit is probably incompatible with mauling). <em>Then</em> if there is still a tie, you look at</p>
					</li>

					<li>		
						<p class="bigger">second person > first person > people > animals > inanimates and abstract concepts</p>


						<p>So if I say "I you see" the meaning is "you see me" because 2nd person outranks first. I need to invert if I want "I see you". But then if there is <em>still</em> a tie, one looks at:</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="bigger"> proximal > obviative</p>

						<p>Which means that proximal arguments, that is things already introduced and that we are referring back to always outrank the others (obviatives) (e.g. in the second clause of "There was a dog, and the dog saw the bear", the dog outranks the bear).</p>

					</li>
					<li>

						<p>If and only if there is still a tie in rank (and it can definitely happen often) we can mark the subject with an <strong>ergative</strong>, which I'd like to call a <strong>desperative</strong>, because you really want to have to do this as little as possible - it's a liability. It can be marked with final reduplication, so say <strong>bzzke</strong> "wolf" could become <strong>bzzkeke</strong> "wolf.ERG".</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Verb bracketing</h3>

				<p>A classical "encryption" feature of Nngba is to insert non-topic arguments <em>inside</em> of verbs with multiple syllables, called somewhat imprecisely verb bracketing. For example</p>

				<p><strong>Dui glo'Nngbakpe.</strong> </p>
				<p>1s sp-Nngba-eak.</p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<h3>Pronouns and Bipronouns</h3>

				<p>Nngba has the ability (and the strong suggestion) to incorporate two pronouns in a single word, called a bipronoun. By themselves, single pronouns (monopronouns) are only inflected for person and there is no distinction between 3rd person and demonstratives (this/that). The table of pronouns is this</p>

				<div class="center">
					<table class="compact_table">
						<tr><th></th>				<th>1s</th>		<th>1p</th>		<th>2</th>		<th>proximal</th> 	<th>obviative</th>	</tr>
						<tr><th>Null (mono)</th>	<td>dui</td>	<td>nmoge</td>	<td>noo</td>		<td>u</td>			<td>tti</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>1s</th>				<td>ndu</td>	<td>X</td>		<td>kau</td>		<td>duu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>1p</th>				<td class="hide"></td>		<td>nmzz</td>		<td>nmau</td>			<td>nmuu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>2</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="2"></td>			<td>na'oo</td>			<td>na'uu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>proximal</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="3"></td>				<td>gebu</td>				<td>buna</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>obviative</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="4"></td>								<td>ttaa</td>			</tr>
					</table>
				</div>

				<p>Cells marked with an X means that dipronoun doesn't exist and you should use two monos.</p>

				<p>Bips are unordered: 1s-prox is the same as prox-1s. It is the alignment rules from before that determine subject and object. If you need to mark a desperative (ergative) as per before, you are sadly forced to split a bipronoun.</p>


				<h3>Consonant Mutation</h3>
				<em>Inspired by the Celtic Languages and Italian...</em>

				<p>Consonant mutation happens when a grammatical word (like a pronoun) ending in a specific vowel comes before a word starting in a certain type of consonant. That consonant is mutated in place of articulation, being either <em>fronted</em> or <em>backed</em>.</p>

				<p>Mutation acts specifically only on the non-coarticulated stops (glottal excluded), so <strong>p b t d tt dd k g</strong>. Fronting acts as <strong>p</strong>←<strong>t</strong>←<strong>tt</strong>←<strong>k</strong> for the unvoiced and <strong>b</strong>←<strong>d</strong>←<strong>dd</strong>←<strong>g</strong> for the voiced (<strong>p b</strong> are unchanged). Backing acts the opposite way (and <strong>k g</strong> are unchanged).</p>



				<p>When the grammatical word ends in <strong>-aa, -i, -ii</strong> it causes fronting, when it ends in <strong>-oo, -u, -uu</strong> they cause backing. Diphthongs and syllabics do not cause mutation (so, <strong>-ui</strong> does not count as <strong>-i</strong> and does not cause fronting). A quick way to remember these rules is to think of "weak" / "strong" fronting/backing, depending on whether it needs a long vowel to happen:</p>

				<div>
					<table class="compact_table">
						<tr><th></th><th>Weak</th><th>Strong</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Fronting</th><td>a</td><td>i</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Backing</th><td>o</td><td>u</td></tr>
					</table>
				</div>

				<p>Here's an example involving personal pronouns:</p>

				<p><strong>Dui glokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<p><strong>Noo ddlokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
				<p>You speak Nngba.</p>

				<p>The lemma is <strong>glokpe</strong>, but the pronoun <strong>noo</strong> has a final vowel <strong>-oo</strong> that induces a backing of <strong>g</strong>→<strong>dd</strong>.</p>

				<h3>Relational nouns</h3>

				<em>(Inspired by the Mayan language)</em>

				<p>One has at a certain point to have to introduce several meanings of relation (spatial, temporal, causal, and a trillion others). So like "on the table", "under the cupboard", "within his body", "before her birth" and so on. We could either do it with prepositions, which would litter speech with a million very common and very recognisable short particles, or we could use an extensive case system, but case systems are complicated, hard to learn, and they have fixed capability that cannot be extended past a certain point. Cases would have to be very irregular to not create detectable patterns, and a lot of cases with a lot of irregularity are unmanageable.</p>

				<p>Relational nouns are a more convenient alternative. Instead of "the cat over the table" you say "cat head table", using the relational noun "head" which also has independent meaning as an anatomical part. A lot of new different relations can be coined using lexical entries (use "guts" for "inside" like the Mayans) and the system has an added layer of ambiguity for whoever doesn't know that the noun <em>is</em> a relational noun. In addition, there can easily be multiple, easy to figure out variants for the same meaning. For example, "behind" could be communicated with "spine" or "ass" or "nape" and already alternation of these three entries makes the notion of "behind" hard to decypher, but a speaker doesn't need to learn any proposition, just has to know names for body parts.</p>

				<p>Relational nouns are placed after the noun </p>

				<h3>Adjectives = Verbs</h3>

				<p>Nngba is a language with ``no adjectives'', meaning that the role of adjectives is fulfilled by stative verbs with the meaning of ``to be <em>that way</em>'' or ``to have <em>that quality</em>''. Conversely, active verbs can tipically also be understood / used as gerunds, with the meaning of ``which <em>performs this action</em>''. We should therefore not really imagine a distinction between the categories of verb and adjective; nevertheless, in the dictionary for clarity we specify the word class for the closest translation. This overlap makes for a very easy to understand system, but there are potential pitfalls when trying to decipher a sentence.</p>

				<p>First of all, Nngba uses adjectives/verbs purely determinatively. There is no space for inessential descriptions or decoration - everything serves to better specify the action in the main verb. So in the phrase <em>the green box was stolen</em>, the adjective <em>green</em> is necessary to specify a box by distinguishing it from others that may not be green, and thus it is determinative information that would survive in an Nngba translation. In <em>she looked at the blue sky</em>, however, <em>blue</em> does not determine, and would not translate directly into Nngba. A more common pattern and better in line with the language's philosophy would be to intentionally use a <em>less specific or even inaccurate noun</em> from which then to specify back in a way that <em>includes accidentally</em> a decorative / poetic element. For example, <em>the sky</em> can be arrived to in a roundabout way as <em>the blue ceiling</em>. The entire construction is unnecessary for the sake of clarity, but it adds a simple layer of additional encryption <em>and</em> allows formally for the usage of <em>blue</em> as a determiner.</p>

				<p>Adjective/verbs almost never inflect. They do not agree with any other part of speech. The only exception is the <strong>inverse</strong> marker for transitive verbs as explained previously.</p>

				<p>The positioning of adjective/verbs is by design by default almost free. It is better in simple, short sentences to mix things up to avoid repeating patterns and constructions, with topic prominence being the guiding principle. Nevertheless, in more complex sentences which are often potentially ambiguous, one typically sets the main clause in SVO (subject verb object) or SOV (subject object verb) order and in intransitive subordinate clauses the verb/adjectives go <em>before</em> the respective nouns, i.e. <em>the tall man</em>, <em>the who had talked man</em>, and so on.</p>

				<h3>Parallel Verbs</h3>

				<p>In Nngba, when multiple verbs are placed in succession within the same sentence with no conjunctions they are understood to be relative clauses. Therefore, a sentence like</p>

				<strong>baker whistle walk</strong>

				<p>reads <em>the baker who whistles is walking</em>, and <em>not</em>, say <em>the baker whistled and walked</em>.</p>

				<h3>Hieroglyphs</h3>

				<p>Nngba is written using emoji-based glyphs that combine a pseudo-logography with a syllabary, called <strong>hieroglyphs</strong> as they are vaguely analogous. Each syllable is represented by a glyph; that glyph is usually logographically related to a word that starts with that same syllable. For example, the word <strong>puugo</strong> means <em>tooth</em>, thus <strong>puu-</strong> gets assigned the glyph <span class="mojis">🦷</span> - but <strong>puugo</strong> itself is written as <strong>puu-go</strong><span class="mojis">🦷☝</span>. In turn, <span class="mojis">☝</span> for <strong>go</strong> comes from <strong>gomaa</strong>, <em>finger</em>, and so on.</p>

				<p>The special glyph <span class="mojis">👌</span> (called <strong>!u!u</strong>) is used to mark reduplication of the following syllable - you don't actually use the same glyph twice!</p>

				<div class="syllabary">
					Loading syllabary...
				</div>

				<p>and many more to come...</p>

				<h3>Dictionary</h3>

				<p>Note: "x" in the hieroglyphs transcription means that syllable has not been assigned a glyph yet.</p>
