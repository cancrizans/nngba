				<li>
					<p><span class="ipa">z̩n̩</span> is also classified as a diphthong because why not. <span class="ipa">/oi/</span> was really originally <span class="ipa">/ui/</span> but it has underwent a sound shift; in romanisation it is still represented as ⟨ui⟩. Diphthongs are as long as a long vowel. <span class="ipa">/ai oi/</span> are allophonic with <span class="ipa">[aːj uːj]</span> and <span class="ipa">/au ua/</span> with <span class="ipa">[aːw waː]</span>. There are no distinct <span class="ipa">/j w/</span> phonemes.</p>
				</li>



				<li>
					<p><span class="ipa">/n ~ l/</span> which encompass <span class="ipa">[n] [ɳ] [ŋ] [l] [ɭ] [ʟ]</span> are allophonic variations or contextual realisations of a single phoneme/archiphoneme, call it <span class="ipa">/N/</span>. Depending on context, it's pronounced as</p>

						<tr><td>N + stop</td> <td>nasal w/ same articulation as the stop</td></tr>

					</table>

					<p>Note that in the rare case <span class="ipa">/Ngm/</span> which is <span class="ipa">/ŋgm/</span> this is not phonemically distinct from <span class="ipa">/ŋ͡m/</span>. When <span class="ipa">/N/</span> occurs before a syllabic <span class="ipa">/n̩/</span>, it is always pronounced as <span class="ipa">/ln̩/</span> independently of context. If <span class="ipa">/n̩n/</span> occurs, it's not phonemically distinct from <span class="ipa">/n̩ː/</span>. <span class="cmnt">idk, this isn't great.</span></p>

					<p>(k,g) + N, which is (k,g) + l, can even go as far as the pre-stopped <span class="ipa">[ɡ͡ʟ]</span>, a characteristic sound of of the language, though simple <span class="ipa">[gl]</span> is a perfectly valid realisation.</p>
				</li>




				<li>
					<p>Ejectives <span class="ipa">[pʼ bʼ]</span> can be substituted to the difficult coarticulated <span class="ipa">/k͡p ɡ͡b/</span>.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>The glottal stop <span class="ipa">/ʔ/</span> is on the boundary between phonemic and not; it is used epenthetically, specifically inserted between adjacent vowels that do not belong to the same syllable. Between words, it is not marked. It can happen only in the middle of a word due to bracketing, in which case it's denoted by an apostrophe <strong>'</strong></p>
				</li>

				<li>The click /!/ can be allophonically realised as dental, alveolar or palatal <span class="ipa">[ǀ ǃ ǂ]</span>, with no distinction. It's generally alveolar <span class="ipa">[ǃ]</span> before <span class="ipa">/o u z̩ n̩/</span>, velar <span class="ipa">[ǂ]</span> before <span class="ipa">/i/</span>, dental or velar <span class="ipa">[ǀ ǂ]</span> before <span class="ipa">/a/</span>. It is however contrastive with /ǁ/ which is always lateral.</li>

				</ol>

				<p>Nngba is written using only ASCII characters, and can be written on most typewriters. The romanisation is as follows:</p>


				<table class="compact_table unicode_font phonetic_table">
					<tr><th>Phoneme</th><td>ʈ</td><td>ɖ</td><td>n</td><td>ɳ</td><td>ŋ</td><td>l</td><td> ɭ</td><td>ʟ</td><td>ŋ͡m</td><td>k͡p</td><td>ɡ͡b</td><td>ǁ</td><td>ʔ</td><td>n̩</td><td>z̩</td><td>ə</td><td>ɔ</td><td>oi</td><td>Long vowels</td></tr>
					<tr><th>Romanisation</th><td>tt</td><td>dd</td><td colspan="3">n</td><td colspan="3">l</td><td>nm</td><td>kp</td><td>gb</td><td>#</td><td>'</td><td>n</td><td>z</td><td>e</td><td>o</td><td>ui</td><td>double letters</td></tr>
				</table>

				<p>Everything else uses the same symbol as in the IPA. Some may also romanise <span class="ipa">ŋ͡m</span> as ngm, but the g glyph is not really necessary as the sequence <span class="ipa">nm</span> (with non-syllabic n) cannot occur.</p>

			<h3>Phonotactics</h3>

			<p>Words are typically one or two syllables long; the rare inflection can increase this number slightly. Bracketing (explained later) can make some unusually long words.</p>

			<p>Syllable structure is as follows:</p>

			<div class="bigger">C(l₁)V(N₂)</div>

			<p>With C any consonant or ', and V strictly one of the allowed vowels or diphthongs, plus some restrictions. Specifically, if C = N, then l₁ can not be there. If the vowel V is a syllabic n, nn, or zn, then N₂ can not be there. If the next syllable opens with any nasal (m, n or nm), then (N₂) can be present but must be realised as l.</p>

			<p>An ``isolated'' N, which means between two vowels as V₁NV₂, is realised as l if V₁ is n, nn, zn. Otherwise, n ~ l are both valid allophonic realisations of N, which is why n and l cannot be said to be distinct phonemes: <strong>puuna</strong> and <strong>puula</strong> are the same word.</p>

				<h3>Syntax and Topic-comment</h3>

				<p>Nngba is <strong>topic-prominent</strong>, which means it puts weight on the distinction between the <em>topic</em> of a sentence, which is what is being talked about, and the <em>comment</em>, which is what it's being said about it. The topic is placed at the beginning of phrases:</p>

				<p><strong>Dui glokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<p>Imagine we want to communicate something slightly different. For example, someone asks "who speaks Nngba here?" and you want to reply "I speak Nngba", as in "Nngba is spoken by me". Even if grammatically the sentence is the same as before, we reinterpret it with Nngba as the topic and "I speak it" as the comment. So it would be said</p>

				<p><strong>Nngba dui glokpe.</strong> </p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<h3>Inverse alignment</h3>

				<em>Inspired by some Meso- and North American languages (ex. Huastec, Algonquian, Navajo...) </em>

				<p>Nngba has a specific alignment system which is vaguely of the Direct-Inverse class and it's designed to prevent repeating particles appearing in a way that could betray the presence of noun classes or hierarchies, while still being relatively if not incredibly simple to work out if you know it already. In a sentence like this</p>

				<p><strong>Dui gboo!n maambe.</strong> 1s eat pear <em>I eat a pear.</em></p>

				<p>it's not really necessary to mark subject and object with either syntax (word order) or morphology (case marking or inflections). It's clear that since "I" is more animate than "pear" it's very likely going to be that I eat the pear rather than the pear eating me, so this is the <em>default</em> reading of sentences. In general there is a specific <strong>indexability hierarchy</strong> of arguments; when there are multiple arguments in a sentence, the outranking one is intended as subject and the other as object.</p>

				<p>If we want to mark specifically that the hierarchy is being inverted, for example we want to say "the pear eats me", we use a specific <strong>Inverse</strong> marker. But this marker is placed on the verb instead of on the arguments (if it was placed on one of the args, it would betray their position in the hierarchy and thus possibly other information about their true meaning, and if it was placed on both, it could risk being too repetitive and easily identified).</p>

				<p><strong>Dui gboo!ndi maambe.</strong> 1s eat-INV pear <em>The pear eats me</em></p>

				<p>To figure out ranking</p>

				<ol> 
					<li>

						<p class="bigger">verb-compatible > verb-incompatible</p>


						<p>That is if it is really unusual for one of the arguments to have been the subject, it gets outranked. (In "The wolf mauled the rabbit", the wolf outranks the rabbit since the rabbit is probably incompatible with mauling). <em>Then</em> if there is still a tie, you look at</p>
					</li>

					<li>		
						<p class="bigger">second person > first person > people > animals > inanimates and abstract concepts</p>


						<p>So if I say "I you see" the meaning is "you see me" because 2nd person outranks first. I need to invert if I want "I see you". But then if there is <em>still</em> a tie, one looks at:</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="bigger"> proximal > obviative</p>

						<p>Which means that proximal arguments, that is things already introduced and that we are referring back to always outrank the others (obviatives) (e.g. in the second clause of "There was a dog, and the dog saw the bear", the dog outranks the bear).</p>

					</li>
					<li>

						<p>If and only if there is still a tie in rank (and it can definitely happen often) we can mark the subject with an <strong>ergative</strong>, which I'd like to call a <strong>desperative</strong>, because you really want to have to do this as little as possible - it's a liability. It can be marked with final reduplication, so say <strong>bzzke</strong> "wolf" could become <strong>bzzkeke</strong> "wolf.ERG".</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Verb bracketing</h3>

				<p>A classical "encryption" feature of Nngba is to insert non-topic arguments <em>inside</em> of verbs with multiple syllables, called somewhat imprecisely verb bracketing. For example</p>

				<p><strong>Dui glo'Nngbakpe.</strong> </p>
				<p>1s sp-Nngba-eak.</p>
				<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

				<h3>Pronouns and Bipronouns</h3>

				<p>Nngba has the ability (and the strong suggestion) to incorporate two pronouns in a single word, called a bipronoun. By themselves, single pronouns (monopronouns) are only inflected for person and there is no distinction between 3rd person and demonstratives (this/that). The table of pronouns is this</p>

				<div class="center">
					<table class="compact_table">
						<tr><th></th>				<th>1s</th>		<th>1p</th>		<th>2</th>		<th>proximal</th> 	<th>obviative</th>	</tr>
						<tr><th>Null (mono)</th>	<td>dui</td>	<td>nmoge</td>	<td>noo</td>		<td>u</td>			<td>tti</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>1s</th>				<td>ndu</td>	<td>X</td>		<td>kau</td>		<td>duu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>1p</th>				<td class="hide"></td>		<td>nmzz</td>		<td>nmau</td>			<td>nmuu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>2</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="2"></td>			<td>na'oo</td>			<td>na'uu</td>			<td>X</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>proximal</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="3"></td>				<td>gebu</td>				<td>buna</td>			</tr>
						<tr><th>obviative</th>				<td class="hide" colspan="4"></td>								<td>ttaa</td>			</tr>
					</table>
				</div>

				<p>Cells marked with an X means that dipronoun doesn't exist and you should use two monos.</p>

				<p>Bips are unordered: 1s-prox is the same as prox-1s. It is the alignment rules from before that determine subject and object. If you need to mark a desperative (ergative) as per before, you are sadly forced to split a bipronoun.</p>


				<h3>Consonant Mutation</h3>
				<em>Inspired by the Celtic Languages and Italian...</em>

				<p>Consonant mutation happens when a grammatical word (like a pronoun) ending in a specific vowel comes before a word starting in a certain type of consonant. That consonant is mutated in place of articulation, being either <em>fronted</em> or <em>backed</em>.</p>

				<p>Mutation acts specifically only on the non-coarticulated stops (glottal excluded), so <strong>p b t d tt dd k g</strong>. Fronting acts as <strong>p</strong>←<strong>t</strong>←<strong>tt</strong>←<strong>k</strong> for the unvoiced and <strong>b</strong>←<strong>d</strong>←<strong>dd</strong>←<strong>g</strong> for the voiced (<strong>p b</strong> are unchanged). Backing acts the opposite way (and <strong>k g</strong> are unchanged).</p>



			<p>When the grammatical word ends in <strong>-aa, -i, -ii</strong> it causes fronting, when it ends in <strong>-oo, -u, -uu</strong> they cause backing. Diphthongs and syllabics do not cause mutation (so, <strong>-ui</strong> does not count as <strong>-i</strong> and does not cause fronting). A quick way to remember these rules is to think of "weak" / "strong" fronting/backing, depending on whether it needs a long vowel to happen:</p>

			<div>
				<table class="compact_table">
					<tr><th></th><th>Weak</th><th>Strong</th></tr>
					<tr><th>Fronting</th><td>a</td><td>i</td></tr>
					<tr><th>Backing</th><td>o</td><td>u</td></tr>
				</table>
			</div>

			<p>Here's an example involving personal pronouns:</p>

			<p><strong>Dui glokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<p><strong>Noo ddlokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
			<p>You speak Nngba.</p>

			<p>The lemma is <strong>glokpe</strong>, but the pronoun <strong>noo</strong> has a final vowel <strong>-oo</strong> that induces a backing of <strong>g</strong>→<strong>dd</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Relational nouns</h3>

			<em>(Inspired by the Mayan language)</em>

			<p>One has at a certain point to have to introduce several meanings of relation (spatial, temporal, causal, and a trillion others). So like "on the table", "under the cupboard", "within his body", "before her birth" and so on. We could either do it with prepositions, which would litter speech with a million very common and very recognisable short particles, or we could use an extensive case system, but case systems are complicated, hard to learn, and they have fixed capability that cannot be extended past a certain point. Cases would have to be very irregular to not create detectable patterns, and a lot of cases with a lot of irregularity are unmanageable.</p>

			<p>Relational nouns are a more convenient alternative. Instead of "the cat over the table" you say "cat head table", using the relational noun "head" which also has independent meaning as an anatomical part. A lot of new different relations can be coined using lexical entries (use "guts" for "inside" like the Mayans) and the system has an added layer of ambiguity for whoever doesn't know that the noun <em>is</em> a relational noun. In addition, there can easily be multiple, easy to figure out variants for the same meaning. For example, "behind" could be communicated with "spine" or "ass" or "nape" and already alternation of these three entries makes the notion of "behind" hard to decypher, but a speaker doesn't need to learn any proposition, just has to know names for body parts.</p>

			<p>Relational nouns are placed after the noun </p>

			<h3>Hieroglyphs</h3>

			<p>Nngba is written using emoji-based glyphs that combine a pseudo-logography with a syllabary, called <strong>hieroglyphs</strong> as they are vaguely analogous. Each syllable is represented by a glyph; that glyph is usually logographically related to a word that starts with that same syllable. For example, the word <strong>puugo</strong> means <em>tooth</em>, thus <strong>puu-</strong> gets assigned the glyph <span class="mojis">🦷</span> - but <strong>puugo</strong> itself is written as <strong>puu-go</strong><span class="mojis">🦷☝</span>. In turn, <span class="mojis">☝</span> for <strong>go</strong> comes from <strong>gomaa</strong>, <em>finger</em>, and so on.</p>

			<p>The special glyph <span class="mojis">👌</span> (called <strong>!u!u</strong>) is used to mark reduplication of the following syllable - you don't actually use the same glyph twice!</p>

			<div class="syllabary">
				Loading syllabary...
			</div>

			<p>and many more to come...</p>

			<h3>Dictionary</h3>

			<p>Note: "x" in the hieroglyphs transcription means that syllable has not been assigned a glyph yet.</p>
